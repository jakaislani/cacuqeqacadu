Anne Stringfield is a popular writer who once worked with The New Yorker magazine as a fact-checker and also wrote on features and articles for the magazine.
She is, however, popular as the wife of one of the US most respected comic actors and stand up comedians, Steve Martin. Despite the vast age differences between Anne Stringfield and her husband, which is over twenty years, the two have, however, proven that age is just a number when it comes to love as they love each other dearly."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
