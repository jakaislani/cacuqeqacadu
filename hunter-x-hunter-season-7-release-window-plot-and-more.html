In fact, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the manga is once again in some sort of unofficial hiatus</a> – which might be for health purposes or just to fill the Dragon Quest-shaped hole in Yoshihiro Togashi’s heart.</p><p data-characters=214 data-current-count=214 data-injectable=false>At the same time, <a href=#>now that the manga has picked up its pace and seems to be far from forgotten</a>, rumors of a season 7 release are also speculated among many fans on social media, so let’s go over what we know.</p><h2 id=h-when-is-hunter-x-hunter-season-7-coming-out data-injectable=false>When is Hunter x Hunter season 7 coming out?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/hisoka-hunter-x-hunter.jpg><p data-characters=389 data-current-count=389 data-injectable=false>At this moment in time, season 7 of Hunter x Hunter hasn’t been announced yet, and for this reason, a release date is still nonexistent. Nothing indicates that the 2011 remake of Togashi’s story will continue, though hope is never lost. Considered by many to be <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the best adaptations of a manga into the animated format</a>, Hunter x Hunter is still incredibly popular today.</p><p data-characters=332 data-current-count=721 data-injectable=true>Considering the story in the manga is currently ongoing, with already two arcs released since the 2011 adaptation, the anime would have quite a bit of content to adapt for the smaller screen. However, the story is far from over, and perhaps the series might only get picked up once a substantial chunk of the plot is fully released.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>What could season 7 from Hunter x Hunter adapt?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Hunter-x-Hunter-manga.jpg><p data-characters=311 data-current-count=611 data-injectable=true>As said above, season 7 isn’t yet confirmed, however, we can already speculate on what it might cover. Since season 6 ended with the 13th Hunter Chairman Election arc, a potential season 7 could still adapt the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dark Continent Expedition, followed by the Succession Contest arc </a>– which is still ongoing.</p><p data-characters=357 data-current-count=357 data-injectable=false>These chunks of the story are more focused on Leorio, Kurapika, and the Phantom Troupe. The arcs also introduce several characters to the narrative, including Isaac Newton’s son and the heirs to the Kakin Empire. Overall, a potential new season would have to adapt 57 chapters of history, comprised of a lot of convoluted information – as expected.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Is the Hunter x Hunter anime over?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Kurapika-Hunter-x-Hunter.jpg><p data-characters=387 data-current-count=387 data-injectable=false>Truthfully, we don’t know if Nippon Animation plans to ever continue the Hunter x Hunter anime. At this moment in time, they don’t have sufficient content to cover, and ideally, they wouldn’t have to rely on filler that could damage the quality of the series. Ultimately, only time will tell if the animation studio will also be adapting the current story in the manga.</p><p data-characters=391 data-current-count=778 data-injectable=true>At the same time, we’re also unsure about the future of the manga itself. Considering Togashi’s chronic health issues, alongside his inability to write or draw for a long period of time, the author has admitted that he has plans if he were never able to finish Hunter x Hunter. Just in 2023, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the author shared with fans an alternative ending that would work as his fourth option</a>.</p><p data-characters=198 data-current-count=198 data-injectable=false>As expected, we might need to wait an unspecified amount of time before we finally get news about Hunter x Hunter and a renewal. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">At least we got a new video game</a>, which is still better than nothing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6hrKeslad6uXnHrqWtnaJiwKat0qilZm9dp7KtscCsnGavmaOxsMOMqaOorF2Wu6V5zKipnmc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./zach-charbonnet-parents-everything-about-the-american-football-running-back.html><span>←</span><span>Zach Charbonnet Parents: Everything About The American Football Running Back</span></a>
