<a href=../../can-you-microwave-sand-to-dry-it-html.html></a>
Answer
As you said, sand, in contrast to water-dense meals, does not carry electricity. However, with a microwave, the food is not cooked by electricity, but rather by being bombarded with microwaves for a period of time. If light radiation is capable of heating up sand, then microwaves are likewise capable of heating up sand that has been placed in a microwave oven.
How can you dry sand rapidly, in the same vein as before?</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Charlie Cox reveals the hidden importance of his controversial Daredevil cameo that you may have mis</h2><time>Jun 24, 2024</time>
