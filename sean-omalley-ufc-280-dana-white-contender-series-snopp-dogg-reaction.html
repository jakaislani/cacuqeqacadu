Welcome to the motherf***ing UFC, O’Malley. I told you motherf***ers that afro was gonna get it!"</p><p>Since earning his UFC contract five years ago, O’Malley has become one of the most recognisable faces in MMA due to his wild fashion sense and ever-changing hairstyles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/10/Screenshot-2022-10-13-164942.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/12/GettyImages-1358512698.jpg><p>The 27-year-old has also made his way into title contention at 135lbs picking up seven wins to earn a fight with former bantamweight champion <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Petr Yan</a> at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">UFC 280</a> in Abu Dhabi on Saturday night.</p><p>O’Malley suffered his first and only career loss against <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Marlon Vera</a> back in 2020 but he still sees himself as undefeated because the quick TKO defeat he suffered was preceded by a foot injury.</p><p>After that, he picked up three knockout wins before stepping up his opposition last time out and facing long-time contender Pedro Munhoz.</p><p>However, the fight ended inconclusively in the second round after the Brazilian fighter absorbed an accidental eye poke and was unable to continue, meaning the fight was declared a no-contest.</p><p>Despite the fact he didn’t get the win last time out, O’Malley is just one fight away from getting a shot at the UFC bantamweight title which will be on the line when Aljamain Sterling faces TJ Dillashaw this weekend in the UFC 280 co-main event.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaG4tLzOq6tnm5%2BifLS8zquraKWdlnxyfpByaHJuX6iyorqMqKSapJyaxm7BxZxka3BgYrGiusBmrqGhpJp6pLvNrZynnJWnerSx0aKcrGWjo7yxvIydpqCfXaeyoq%2FToqanZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./perfect-host-review.html><span>←</span><span>The Perfect Host Review</span></a>
