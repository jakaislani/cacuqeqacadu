Coupling up on day one in the villa and remaining faithful to one another until the very end (with the exception of the infamous Casa Amor week, where Deb coupled up with Kyle Fraser) Deb and Jesse made the decision to pursue a relationship with one another outside of the villa after their Love Island: USA journey came to a close, however, it was short-lived.</p><p data-characters=752 data-current-count=752 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The duo called it quits in December of 2022</a>, just four months after&nbsp;Love Island: USA&nbsp;wrapped (and one month before Zeta and Timmy’s split). Deb and Jesse announced via their respective Instagram stories that they are better off as friends rather than romantic partners — “I just wanted to let you all know that Jesse and I have made the difficult decision to go our separate ways… We work better as friends and will always have love and respect for each other. We will always cherish our memories and time together as we went through this incredible experience… We are so grateful for all of the love and support and hope you will continue to support us in our individual journeys,” Deb shared with her 251,000 followers.</p><p data-characters=315 data-current-count=315 data-injectable=false>Despite failing to find her perfect match, Deb is still extremely invested in the&nbsp;Love Island&nbsp;franchise, hosting a finale party for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">season five of&nbsp;Love Island: USA</a>, attending a pop-up villa for&nbsp;Love Island: USA in Austin, and now&nbsp;competing on the inaugural season of&nbsp;Love Island Games.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Scott van-der-Sluis (Love Island: UK season 10 and Love Island: USA season 5)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Scott-Love-Island-Games.png><p data-characters=489 data-current-count=489 data-injectable=true>Entering the villa as a bombshell on day 11, Scott van-der-Sluis had a rather lackluster journey on Love Island: UK. Attempting to form a connection with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Catherine Agbaje</a>, Jess Harding, Amber Wise, Abi Moores, and more, Scott found himself unlucky in love time and time again during his time on the hit competition show, causing him to be dumped from the villa on day 56, just short of the finale. Fortunately for viewers, his time within the Love Island franchise did not end there…</p><p data-characters=456 data-current-count=456 data-injectable=true>Almost instantaneously after being dumped from the villa, Scott caught a flight to Fiji to join Love Island: USA as a bombshell as well, where he found himself failing to find his perfect match for the second time. Despite going on dates with both <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kassy Castillo</a> and Imani Wheeler, he coupled up with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Johnnie Garcia</a> at the re-coupling ceremony, however, they were eliminated just one week later after being deemed the “least compatible couple.”</p><p data-characters=257 data-current-count=257 data-injectable=false>Now, competing on the inaugural season of Love Island Games, Scott has made history as the contestant to appear the most times on the hit competition show, being a part of three different iterations of Love Island in under three months — how wild is that?</p><p data-characters=141 data-current-count=398 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Despite admitting to being on Love Island Games for the money</a>, will Scott unexpectedly find love this time around?

Mitch had quite the journey on season 3 of Love Island: Australia, remaining faithful to Tina Provis throughout his time in the villa (with the exception of day 10, where he coupled up with Emily Ward and Tina coupled up with Taku Chimwaza), coasting them all the way to finale night and earning them the win.</p><p data-characters=514 data-current-count=514 data-injectable=true>Just three months after Love Island: Australia&nbsp;wrapped, Mitch and Tina took to their respective Instagram stories to announce their split (amid allegations that Mitch cheated on Tina with Emily post-filming), however, the pair got back together with one another shortly after. With both individuals returning for season 4 of Love Island: Australia, the duo rekindled their romance in the villa, however they broke up once and for all shortly after their second time on Love Island: Australia came to a close.</p><p data-characters=220 data-current-count=220 data-injectable=false>With both Mitch and Tina appearing on the inaugural season of Love Island Games, our fingers are crossed that the two lovebirds find their way back to one another.

It’s with a very sad, heavy heart that I tell you guys, Mitch and I are no longer together. I’m so devastated to be sharing this news with you and I am still processing the situation. Sadly, this was not our time and we agreed that the best decision for us right now is to part ways,” Tina shared with her 168,000 followers.</p><p data-characters=282 data-current-count=282 data-injectable=false>While Tina appears to be living her best life, modeling for brands like Hello Molly, attending sporting events like the FIFA Women’s World Cup, and more based on her Instagram profile, she might just find someone to share it with on the inaugural season of Love Island Games.</p><p data-characters=60 data-current-count=342 data-injectable=false>Who knows?

Aurelia entered the villa on day one (just moments after the re-coupling ceremony), giving her the opportunity to “steal” whichever islander she wanted for herself. She decided to couple up with Henrik Stoltenberg (“stealing” him from Anna Iff), however, their relationship did not last long.</p><p data-characters=212 data-current-count=212 data-injectable=false>After breaking up with Henrik, Aurelia decided to self-eliminate from the beloved competition series on day 25, as she failed to make a connection with any of the other contestants besides Henrik — poor thing!</p><p data-characters=187 data-current-count=399 data-injectable=false>With the sneak peek of episode 15 teasing a relationship between her and Johnny Middlebrooks on Love Island Games, could Aurelia finally find her perfect match?
