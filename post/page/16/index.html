It begins with Chris Rock declaiming that the only group of people in the world who say exactly what they want to say are stand-up comedians. And the rest of the movie is about the misery they have to endure in order to do that. An early appearance by Jerry Seinfeld will take the inside-baseball-inclined back to “Comedian,” the 2002 documentary in which the spectacularly successful performer goes back to his comedy-basement roots and experiences the exact same anxieties as he did when he was a nobody honing his craft.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Subaru Outback Forum List of Subaru Outback Discussions and Forums</h2><time>Aug 14, 2024</time>
