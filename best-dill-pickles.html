But have you tasted 37 different types of dill pickles? We have. And that’s why we’re confident in our list of the best dill pickles.</p><p>There are 12 on here that will satisfy all your dill pickle cravings, whether you’re looking for the best garlic dill pickles, the best dill pickle chips, the best spicy dill pickles, the best dill pickle spears, or even the best pickles for burgers. We found the best dill pickles if you only get your pickles from the refrigerated section, as well as the best dill pickles if you want to stock up on shelf-stable jars for the apocalypse.&nbsp;</p><p>While everyone has slightly different preferences when it comes to pickles, we can all agree that the best dill pickles should meet certain criteria when it comes to flavor, taste, and juiciness. Dill pickles should actually taste like dill (obviously), along with some other complementary flavors like garlic, peppercorns, and chile peppers if we’re talking spicy dill pickles. They should be crunchy and never mushy. Lastly, they need to be super juicy—the kind of juicy where you have to suck in the juice while you bite the pickle so the juice doesn’t get all over your clothes. If a dill pickle can fulfill all those requirements, it’s not just a good dill pickle, it’s the best dill pickle. Over the course of multiple taste tests, we tried some of the top dill pickle brands on the market in order to find the best dill pickles out there. (If you’re looking for the <a href=#>best bread and butter pickles</a>, we can help you out, too.) Here are the best dill pickles we found to be absolutely dill-icious.</p><p class=has-small-font-size>The following article contains affiliate links that may generate a small commission to us when you make a purchase through the link.

At first, I thought, “These are too much.” But after a few more bites, I was hooked. My mouth puckers just thinking about these. They might be a little too potent for most people to eat alone, but they are the best dill pickles to dice and mix into a tuna, egg, or <a href=#>potato salad</a>.

These miniature whole pickles are crunchy, dilly, and just a touch sweet—perhaps from the apple cider vinegar in the mix. But most of all, they’re spicy. They have a great heat that keeps building the more you eat. They’re not so hot that you can’t eat a couple, but if you’re at all sensitive to spice, you should steer clear. — Justine Sterling</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=#>All the Wickles Pickles, Ranked</a></p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Amazon</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>7.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim" style=background-color:#7cab82></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="Great Value Whole Kosher Dill Pickles" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/RANKING-UPDATE_DILL-PICKLES_INSET-09.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Small Whole Pickle</p><strong>Great Value Whole Kosher Dill Pickles</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Walmart</a><p>&nbsp;love a small, whole pickle.

It has a crunchier crunch and Great Value Whole Dill Pickles are no exception. Their flavor is specifically pickle. It’s not exclusively dill. It’s not garlic or peppercorns or even vinegar. It’s all the ingredients coming together to make a unique, store-bought pickle taste that I love. And I don’t know if it’s just me, but holding a pickle this tiny feels very cute.

They are mouthwateringly tangy and spiced. They are super savory. But what set them apart from the others was their crunch. These are crunchy! And, in my opinion, the best pickles for burgers need crunch—you want them to add both flavor and texture.

You don’t put them on a <a href=#>charcuterie board</a>. You definitely don’t put them on a burger. A snacking pickle exists solely to be fished out of the jar with your bare hands and eaten over the sink as a midday treat. OH SNAP! Dilly Bites are snacking pickles minus the mess! They are small pickle chips that come in a bag and are surrounded by almost no liquid. They’re salty, dilly, and completely drip-free.

They are super crunchy and pack a ton of heat. They have a bit of that sushi bar pickled ginger flavor, too. But really, seriously, they’re spicy.

If you are a pickle person, you already knew that. But, for those who didn’t, this is your heads-up. You can tell that they’re next level as soon as you peer through the clear container. Big chunks of garlic and whole sprigs of dill swim around each perfectly placed green (not neon) pickle spear. They give you a sour vinegar kick while maintaining a light, cucumbery flavor and classic cucumbery crunch. Plus, the cartoon pickle on the container is cool as hell. They might not be the number one best dill pickles on this list, but they are the best garlic dill pickles and certainly worth buying—especially if you like half-sour pickles. And don’t look for them on the shelf, they’re some of the best refrigerator dill pickles, so you’ll find them chilling. — Jordan Myrick</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Ryan Martin / Walmart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim" style=background-color:#85af7d></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="Claussen Kosher Dill Halves" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/RANKING-UPDATE_DILL-PICKLES_INSET-13.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Halves</p><strong>Claussen Kosher Dill Halves</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Target</a><p>Claussen’s Kosher Dill Halves are the best dill pickles according to my colleague <a href=#>Gwynedd Stuart</a>, so she yelled at me for not having them on the original list. I’ll admit when I’m wrong, and I was wrong. I bought the wrong Claussen dill pickles for the initial test. These kosher dill halves are incredible. They are the best crunchy dill pickles straight out of the fridge. They have impeccable flavor, and delicious brine. You’d be thrilled if you got this pickle from a sandwich shop or on your plate at a diner. Luckily, you don’t even have to leave your house to enjoy them on a regular basis. Make sure you look for them in the refrigerator section, though!
