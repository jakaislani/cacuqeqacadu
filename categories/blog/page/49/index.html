However, this character is not interested in making it easy for the audience to empathize with her. Linklater can’t seem to strike the right tone for Bernadette’s story, so in some moments, she’s comically ill-equipped to handle the slightest of domestic chores and foists a number of her personal tasks on an unseen digital assistant based in India.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>American Media Personalities, Dylan Dreyer &amp;amp; Brian Fichera Exchanged Their Wedding Vows In A Grand C</h2><time>Jun 13, 2024</time>
