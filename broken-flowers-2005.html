"Give them pink flowers and watch their reaction." Don nods, barely, and embarks on his journey -- not to discover if he has a child, so much as to discover if he wants a child. At one point he phones Winston from the road, complaining that he has been supplied with conventional rental cars. Why couldn't he have a Porsche? "I'm a stalker in a Taurus."</p><p>No actor is better than Bill Murray at doing nothing at all, and being fascinating while not doing it. <a href=#>Buster Keaton</a> had the same gift for contemplating astonishing developments with absolute calm. Buster surrounded himself with slapstick, and in "Broken Flowers" <a href=#>Jim Jarmusch</a> surrounds Murray with a parade of formidable women.</p><p>First stop, Laura (<a href=#>Sharon Stone</a>). Her husband was a NASCAR champion, but "died in a wall of flame." Her daughter (<a href=#>Alexis Dziena</a>), who is named Lolita, offers Don her Popsicle and, unmistakably, herself. Neither daughter nor mother seems to know that the name Lolita has literary associations. Don does in fact spend the night with the mother, but we do not see precisely what goes on, and just as well: The sight of this passive and withdrawn man making love might be sad beyond calculation.</p><p>Second woman, Dora (<a href=#>Frances Conroy</a>) who with her husband Ron (<a href=#>Christopher McDonald</a>) is a realtor, specializing in selling "quality prefabs" and currently living in a "wonderful example." Don's dinner with Dora and Ron grows unspeakably depressing after he asks the wrong question.</p><p>Third woman, Carmen (<a href=#>Jessica Lange</a>), protected by her ambiguous assistant (<a href=#>Chloe Sevigny</a>). Carmen is an "animal communicator," who talks to people's pets on their behalf. The movie doesn't take cheap shots at this occupation, but suggests Carmen may be the real thing. "Is he saying something?" Don asks, as Carmen converses with her cat. Carmen: "He says you have a hidden agenda."</p><p>The fourth woman, Penny (<a href=#>Tilda Swinton</a>) has a front yard full of motorcycles, and lives in an atmosphere that makes Don feel threatened, not without reason. There was a fifth possible candidate, who has been eliminated from Don's list because, well, she's dead.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46bqaijlaN6p7jOsJyrq11nfXGB</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-charlie-christie-meet-maude-apatow-boyfriend-did-they-split.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Charlie Christie?
