(They also didn't have rice, but that didn't come from the Americas.)&nbsp;
Rather, as&nbsp;The Spruce Eats&nbsp;explains, the everyday elements of ancient Greek cuisine included grains like wheat and barley (frequently used to make bread), beans and other legumes, fruits and vegetables, and cheese made from sheep or goat's milk.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Windows 8 Gets A Launch Date: October 26th</h2><time>Aug 8, 2024</time>
