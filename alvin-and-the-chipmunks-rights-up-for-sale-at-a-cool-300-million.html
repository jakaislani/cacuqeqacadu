Sure, they were largely terrible and drove parents all over the world mad, but Alvin and the Chipmunks, The Squeakuel, Chipwrecked and The Road Chip combined to earn almost $1.4 billion at the box office, so there’s evidently still some value left in the IP.</p><p data-characters=393 data-current-count=393 data-injectable=false>The CNBC report names ViacomCBS as an interested party, but does also mention that talks have been held with a number of potential buyers. A streaming service is almost certainly among them, because <strong>Alvin and the Chipmunks </strong>has already been proven as a viable and reliable source of content for decades, and new TV shows or films would be of huge benefit to several platforms looking to expand.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomKWumaN6orrDZquhnV2Ytaq8zK6lpKtdp7aotNOsZK6oXZu8s3nSmqOeZZGpeqJ5wqimpWVjZX1uucilo6KnnmQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./timmythick.html><span>←</span><span>The Seventeen Years Old Instagram Star, Timmy Thick Is Single</span></a>
