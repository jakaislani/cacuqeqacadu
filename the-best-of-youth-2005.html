<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>The Best of Youth movie review (2005)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>The brothers are Nicola and Matteo Carati (<a href=#>Luigi Lo Cascio</a> and <a href=#>Alessio Boni</a>). We meet their parents, Angelo (Andrea Tidona) and Adriana (<a href=#>Adriana Asti</a>), their older sister Giovanna (Lidia Vitale), and their kid sister Francesca. And we meet their friends, their lovers, and others who drift through, including a mental patient whose life seems to follow in parallel.</p><p>As the film opens, Nicola has qualified as a doctor and Matteo is still taking literature classes. Matteo, looking for a job, has been hired as a "logotherapist" -- literally, a person who takes mental patients for walks. One of the women he walks with is Giorgia (<a href=#>Jasmine Trinca</a>), who is beautiful, deeply wounded by electroshock therapy, and afraid of the world. On the spur of the moment, Matteo decides to spring her from the institution and take her along when he and Nicola take a summer trip to the "end of the world," the tip of Norway.</p><p>Giorgia is found by the police, but has the presence of mind to protect the brothers. Nicola continues on his journey and gets a job as a lumberjack, and Matteo returns to Rome and, impulsively, joins the army. They are to meet again in Florence, where catastrophic floods have drowned the city. Nicola is a volunteer, Matteo is a soldier assigned to the emergency effort, and in the middle of the mud and ruins, Nicola hears a young woman playing a piano that has been left in the middle of the street.</p><p>This is Giulia (<a href=#>Sonia Bergamasco</a>). Their eyes meet and lock, and so do their destinies. They live together without marrying, and have a daughter, Sara. Giulia is drawn into a secret Red Brigade cell. She draws apart from her family. One night she packs to leave the house. He tries to block her way, then lets her go. She disappears into the terrorist underground.</p><p>Matteo meanwhile joins the police, takes an assignment in Sicily because no one else wants to go there, and meets a photographer in a cafe. This is Mirella (<a href=#>Maya Sansa</a>). She wants to be a librarian, and he advises her to work at a beautiful library in Rome. Years later, he walks into the library and sees her for the second time in his life. They become lovers, but there is a great unexplained rage within Matteo, maybe also self-hatred, and he will not allow anyone very close.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tn55lkprAtXnOn2Syp6WptW5%2Bj2ls</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sophocles-iraia-clement-wiki-age-parents-ethnicity-net-worth-height-career.html><span>←</span><span>Sophocles Iraia Clement- Wiki, Age, Parents, Ethnicity, Net Worth, Height, Career</span></a>
