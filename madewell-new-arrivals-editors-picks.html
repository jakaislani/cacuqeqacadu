Sure, there's the urge to refold the shirt stack and finger-space hangers behind customers, but the main reason? No longer having that coveted employee discount. (If you knew how cheap you could get a T-shirt with it, you wouldn't want to pay the new-season price, either.) However, there are some things that are just worth it, even without a discount — which is why I'm here to guide you through <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Madewell's latest arrivals</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As a former Madewell employee, I know exactly what's worth buying that'll give you the most bang for your buck. I personally can't resist the retailer's newest clothing and accessories drop, which features farmhouse-inspired dresses, an assortment of fall-ready loafers and mules, and a number of new denim pieces. After sorting through 780+ new goodies, these are the five latest <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Madewell items</a> I'll be adding to my cart:</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-perfect-vintage-wide-leg-jean-belmere-wash></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Perfect Vintage Wide Leg Jean, Belmere Wash</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Madewell has become synonymous with jeans, and the best part is that it often restocks favorites and offers new iterations of best sellers all while introducing fresh styles. The Perfect Vintage <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>quickly became a customer-loved staple</a>; made with 99 percent cotton, it's more long-lasting and structured than other options and has been reworked several times to fit the latest denim trends. I'll be buying the newest version, which features a relaxed wide leg in a timeless black wash. As someone with no plans to revisit skinny jeans, this looser fit, which I'm just as excited to wear with sneakers as I am heels, is something that I know will become a go-to piece in my wardrobe.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now:</strong> $138, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">madewell.com</a></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-caldwell-double-breasted-blazer-hedden-plaid></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Caldwell Double-Breasted Blazer, Hedden Plaid</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you like a Madewell blazer, it's not something you wait to buy — the fall styles sell out quickly. The Caldwell blazer structure is classic, so you know you'll reach for it year after year, and it's the ideal outerwear piece for early fall weather. More than 1,000 people have added this gorgeous plaid option to their cart in the last week, so act fast before it's gone.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now: </strong>$178, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">madewell.com</a></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-piazza-crossbody-bag></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Piazza Crossbody Bag</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With each Madewell clothing drop, there came one bag nearly every employee left their shift with. This season, it'll be the Piazza Crossbody (it also comes in a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">mini and tote version</a>). Available in three colors including tan, black, and evergreen, the bag has stylish drawstrings and is similar in style to designer options, but at a fraction of the price. Made from a plush leather, this is a bag you'll get more than a season's wear out of — a solid justification for a full-price purchase.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now:</strong> $158, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">madewell.com</a></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-gauze-sophia-midi-dress></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Gauze Sophia Midi Dress</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There are quite <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">a few new dresses</a> I'm eyeing, but I'll be opting for this plaid Sophia Midi Dress that has fall written all over it. Made out of a stretchy, cotton gauze fabric, its romantic and breezy silhouette is ideal for when you want to look like you're trying without the work. It's also available in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">a twill design</a> that comes in solid colors.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now:</strong> $138, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">madewell.com</a></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-bradley-lugsole-loafer-in-leather></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Bradley Lugsole Loafer in Leather</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If there's one thing I'll continue to buy from Madewell regardless of price, it's the shoes. I've owned mules that withstood three years of wear and heels that passed the nine-hour-shift-entirely-on-your-feet test. Given that chunky loafers are the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>It-girl shoe of the moment</a> — everyone from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Bella Hadid</a> to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Jane Fonda</a> has been wearing them — the Bradley Lugsole Loafer is a must-have for anyone's fall shoe collection. It comes in three colors, has cushy padded soles, and is available in sizes 5 to 12.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now: </strong>$158, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">madewell.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xZqqoaGfo3yurcOerp6knGK7psOMmqmroaaWubR5xJ2graeiqHqxtcKkqg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./stanley-kubrick-1928-1998.html><span>←</span><span>Stanley Kubrick 1928-1998 | Interviews</span></a>
