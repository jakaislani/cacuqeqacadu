Josh Dallas, her Once Upon a Time co-star and husband, is the father of her two sons. The couple, on the other hand, places a high value on their privacy. As a result, not much is known about their relationship.</p><p>Similarly, they have yet to reveal the identities of their children. Everything we know about the Goodwin-Dallas family is listed below.</p><h2>Josh Dallas and Ginnifer Goodwin’s Relationship</h2><p>Before they were together, Goodwin and Dallas had other partners. Joey Kern was the actress’s boyfriend at the time, and they got engaged in December 2010.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Ginnifer-Goodwin.jpg><p>Their relationship, however, did not last, and they called it quits in May 2011. In contrast, Dallas was married to Lara Pulver. They married in 2007 and then divorced four years later. On the set of Once Upon a Time, Goodwin and Dallas first met.</p><p>Snow White / Mary Margaret Blanchard was played by Goodwin, while Prince Charming / David Nolan was played by Dallas. Their love story is like a fairy tale, just like the show they met on.</p><p>For both of them, it was love at first sight, and they were ecstatic when they met. However, they initially stated that they were just friends. In 2011, they began dating soon after.</p><p>When they first started dating, the actress knew she was going to marry Dallas. She realized she was pregnant when they were at Disneyland.</p><p>Dallas was visiting the “happiest place on Earth” for the first time, and they were riding the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad. The actor was ecstatic, exclaiming on the way home that it was the best day of his life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Ginnifer-Goodwin-ks.jpg><p>Goodwin knew right away that she wanted Dallas to be her husband. Their relationship grew stronger over time, and the actor proposed in October 2013.</p><p>On April 12, 2014, the couple married in a beautiful but intimate wedding ceremony in California. They’ve been married for nearly eight years, and their love grows stronger with each passing year.</p><p>The couple frequently brags about each other on Instagram, gushing about how much they adore each other. Their relationship has also been strengthened by their children.</p><h2>The Kids from Dallas</h2><p>Dallas was already expecting her first child when she proposed to Goodwin. She was eight months pregnant at the time of the wedding, and they welcomed their baby boy, Oliver, a month later, on May 29, 2014.<br>In 2015, the actor told Us Weekly that his wife was the “greatest mother” he had ever met.</p><p>He claimed that despite the hardships and sleepless nights, the couple was making it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Ginnifer-Goodwin-nn.jpg><p>The couple announced they were expecting again in November 2015. Because they already had Oliver, Goodwin admitted that her second pregnancy was easier than her first.</p><p>Hugo, the couple’s second child, was born on June 1, 2016. When Oliver was born, Goodwin and Dallas did not hire a nanny, but after Hugo, they hired people to help them out.<br>The couple has never revealed the identities of their children. Dallas frequently updates his social media accounts, particularly Instagram, with photos of the kids, but their faces are always blurred or hidden.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Ginnifer Goodwin</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Ginnifer Goodwin Husband</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGieoqaenrOmvoygpqicp567bq3NnWShnaJitba%2FwZqlnWWRp7JusdecnKWklaPBbrzAq5ynrKNk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./elikem-kumordzie-finally-opens-up-on-why-he-divorced-pokello.html><span>←</span><span>Elikem Kumordzie Finally Opens Up On Why He Divorced Pokello</span></a>
