Bombay Bitchin’ Sauce is the solution to dry, dull chicken. It’s savory and salty and adds major depth of flavor. As Sporked senior writer <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jordan Myrick</a> wrote, “I would love to pour this over a rotisserie chicken leg and go to town,” and coming from someone who’s done this very same thing on the couch in my underwear while watching Survivor, this is the move.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Every Flavor of Bitchin’ Sauce, Ranked</a></strong></p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Good & Gather Chopped Caesar Salad Kit</strong></a><p>“Rip everything open and throw it into a bowl” is the perfect parameter for the task at hand. That’s where salad kits come in. Shitty pro tip, you can even mix it in the bag, which was my go-to move for three weeks when I worked in an office and wanted to stop eating at the Jimmy John’s down the street every single day. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jordan called this a restaurant-quality salad in a bag</a>, which is why I grab it to pair with my rotisserie chicken—for an added dash of class.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Every Target Salad Kit, Ranked</a></strong></p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Bob Evans Roasted Garlic & Herb Mashed Cauliflower</strong></a><p>Microwavable mashed cauliflower is the most convenient way to get any semblance of health into a convenience meal. Miss us with the boiling, mashing, and mixing. A pre-prepared tray I can throw in the microwave? That’s magic. This Bob Evans Roasted Garlic & Herb Mashed Cauliflower has a bold and savory herb flavor, and it’s so creamy you could mistake it for mashed potatoes. I put this on my plate so I feel a little less guilty for choosing convenience over a home-cooked meal after a long day at work.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Potato Alternatives: Mashes, Tots, and More</a></strong></p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Stove Top Traditional Sage Stuffing Mix</strong></a><p>Making Stove Top stuffing borders on cooking, but it really is so simple that I let it slide. Boil water and butter, dump in a box of stuffing—voila. Mushy, delicious bread. My body runs on bread, so, technically, I need this to survive. This particular stuffing mix topped the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sporked charts</a> because, as managing editor <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gwynedd Stuart</a> noted, “It’s fluffy and savory, and even has a little bit of sweetness, thanks to the addition of dehydrated carrots.” Your brain won’t even realize you’re eating tiny bits of vegetables.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Best Boxed Stuffing</a></strong></p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Knorr Roasted Chicken Gravy Mix</strong></a><p>Okay, you get your delicious-looking chicken home to discover it’s been under that heat lamp a little too long. Gravy is the answer. Honestly, no matter the question, gravy is the answer. You can even use the back of spoon to make streaks of gravy on your plate and pretend you’re eating at a Michelin-starred restaurant, even though you’re just eating a packet of mix that only required water and a whisk. According to the Sporked crew, who got down on a bunch of instant gravy back around Thanksgiving time, this is as close as you can get to homemade gravy without asking <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a grocery store deli worker</a> to hand over some pan drippings. The perfect gravy for an (almost) zero-effort rotisserie chicken night.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Best Store Bought Gravy</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaK%2BYlsFuwM5mnJqsXay2tbSMq6atoaOosrO1xGaaoaGToLKvew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./maxwell-simba.html><span>←</span><span>Maxwell Simba</span></a>
