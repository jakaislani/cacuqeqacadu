Even if you can't physically see it, there will likely be resin or tar buildup, which is the light brown to black substance that collects after burning flower in a pipe. This is different from <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module=body_link>live resin</a>, which is a solvent-based resin from fresh plants.&nbsp;</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module=body_link>Leafly</a> editor and commercial grower <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module=body_link>Pat Goggins</a>, this residual resin will "make hits harsher, perhaps inducing a coughing fit, and dull the flavor of the smoke." It may also be tough to get any smoke out of the pipe if it's totally clogged, which is a another clear sign you're in need of a clean.</p><p>The good news is, glass pipes can be restored to their original sparkling glory with just a bit of patience and some household items you already have on hand.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Quick tip:</strong> As with anything you use frequently, glass cannabis pipes need to be cleaned to maintain effectiveness, prevent buildup, and prevent any bacteria growth. Experts recommend cleaning your pipe weekly if you use it frequently, or as soon as you notice any signs of buildup.&nbsp;</p><p>Advertisement</p><h2><strong>How to clean a glass pipe</strong></h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><a class=image-click-enlarge href=# data-click-enlarge data-credit-href data-component-type=click-to-enlarge rel=nofollow data-analytics-product-module=body_link></a><span class=image-source-caption>Coarse salt is optional, but it helps remove any hard-to-reach gunk that might be stuck in the pipe. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Winslow Productions/Getty Images</span></span></figure><p>Cleaning a glass pipe is quite simple and requires very few tools, just some household ingredients. The alcohol helps remove resin and bacteria, while the salt adds friction to remove any extra-tough bits.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>What you need&nbsp;</strong></h3><ul><li>Isopropyl alcohol (90% preferably, 70% minimum)</li><li>Zip-top bag&nbsp;</li><li>Coarse salt (optional)</li><li>Cotton swabs (optional)</li></ul><p>Advertisement</p><h3><strong>Instructions&nbsp;</strong></h3><li aria-level=1><strong>Fill the pipe with isopropyl alcohol and salt.</strong> Use about a teaspoon of salt per four inches of pipe, then fill it almost all the way with alcohol. If you don't have coarse salt on hand, you can skip it, but it will help to dislodge particularly stuck-on gunk.&nbsp;</li><li aria-level=1><strong>Shake the pipe.</strong> Plug the holes with your fingers and give it a vigorous shake, up to 2 minutes. You can also put the pipe into a small zip-top bag and plug the holes&nbsp;with your fingers from the outside to prevent any spillage while shaking.</li><li aria-level=1><strong>Pour the mixture out.</strong> Once you pour the salt and alcohol mixture out, check to see how much buildup has been removed, and repeat again if necessary. You'll know it's clean when there's little to no debris left behind and the alcohol runs clear. David Morrissey, owner of <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Cannabis Experts</a>, a company that sells equipment and services in the cannabis industry, recommends using cotton swabs to get into the nooks and crannies at this stage.&nbsp;</li><li aria-level=1><strong>Soak the piece.</strong> If you're finding that this method isn't doing the trick (as in, there are a lot of stuck-on bits left inside the piece), Morrissey says you'll want to soak the piece for a few hours or overnight. In this case, put the pipe in a zip-top bag&nbsp; (like <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener sponsored">this reusable silicone one</a> made for pipe cleaning) and pour in isopropyl alcohol until the pipe is submerged.&nbsp;</li><li aria-level=1><strong>Let it dry.</strong> Once the pipe is cleaned to your liking, rinse it under some warm water and let it dry completely, about 1 to 2 hours, before using.&nbsp;</li><p><strong>Note: </strong>Water from bongs, bubblers, and from cleaning glass pipes is sticky and resinous, and shouldn't be poured down the drain. You can toss it in the trash in a sealed container (like an old water bottle) or the zip-top bag you're using for cleaning.&nbsp;</p><p>Advertisement</p><h2><strong>Is there a way to clean a glass pipe without rubbing alcohol?</strong></h2><p>By and large, experts and regular smokers will tell you that the alcohol and salt method is the easiest, cheapest, and most effective method. Morrissey has tried cleaning pipes with water and dish soap before, but he says he always comes back to alcohol, because it rarely leaves any debris behind and it has effective antibacterial properties.&nbsp;</p><p>While isopropyl alcohol and coarse salt will certainly get the job done, lots of cannabis users also turn to specialized cleaners which tend to work faster and require less direct attention.&nbsp;</p><p>Many recommend a product called <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener sponsored noindex" data-analytics-product-module=body_link data-am-orig-url="https://affiliate.insider.com/?h=1f669360233d0eb23f1efb60d7012a8740f5e1185f1bd2946a371ef066f514a8&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGrunge-Off-Super-Soaker-Cleaner%2Fdp%2FB002LURISY%2Fref%3Dasc_df_B002LURISY%2F" class=sj-link>Grunge Off</a>, which requires no alcohol, salt, or shaking.&nbsp;</p><p>Simply fill the pipe with the solution, let it sit for at least 30 minutes, or overnight, and rinse with warm water.&nbsp;</p><p>Advertisement</p><h2><strong>Insider's takeaway</strong></h2><p>Cleaning your glass pipe is essential to maintaining its efficiency, as well as improving the taste and smell of your cannabis. Experts recommend regular users to clean their pipes once weekly, or at least when they start to notice resin buildup. The most popular method is to fill the pipe with coarse salt and isopropyl alcohol, plug up the holes with your fingers, and give it a good shake to dislodge stuck resin and particles.</p><a id=post-author_profile-link href=# data-analytics-product-module=author-bio rel></a><a id=post-author_name-link class="post-author_link not-content-link" href=# data-analytics-product-module=author-bio rel><p>Caroline Mullen</p></a><p>Freelance Reporter</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSoqWeq6Oeu7S1w56pZ5ufonyowcidnKxnmKS6pnvHqK5mrJ9isK2xwKdkmmWXoa60v4ypoKmd</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./casey-desantis-family.html><span>←</span><span>Casey DeSantis Family With Husband Ron DeSantis And 3 Children</span></a>
