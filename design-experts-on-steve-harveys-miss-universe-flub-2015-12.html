The fact that the first two were flush left and the winner was flush right was the reason for the confusion. It was similar with the butterfly ballot of 2000; people didn't understand the order in which they were reading things.</p><p>Up first should have been MISS UNIVERSE; 1st runner up should have been next, and then 2nd runner-up.
