And I think we were really … excited about telling a story that was a little different from what people might come to expect.”</p><p>“There’s romance because Lacey’s character has a romantic love interest, and I have a story with my wife in the movie,” the actor shared. “But I think we were really excited that Hallmark embraced this story that was about … family.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized">Scott Wolf and Lacey Chabert in “A Merry Scottish Christmas.” <span class=credit>©Hallmark Entertainment/Courtesy Everett Collection</span></figure><p>“A Merry Scottish Christmas” dropped on the Hallmark channel Nov. 19, and it isn’t your typical holiday TV movie full of romance and fantasy.</p><p>The movie encompasses two estranged siblings who haven’t seen each other in quite some time.

Once people see the movie, I think the vomit emojis will go away.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Wolf and Chabert reunited 23 years after “Party of Five” for their newest Hallmark flick. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>“Just hearts,” Chabert interjected.</p><p>Chabert portrayed youngest daughter Claudia Salinger on “Party of Five” from 1993 until 2000 while Wolf took on the role of her older brother, Bailey Salinger.</p><p>The two starred alongside “Scream” star Neve Campbell and “Lost” alum Matthew Fox.

I love him so much, and I have missed him every day since ‘Party of Five’ ended. This was a beautiful reunion.”</p><p>The pair have stayed close since the conclusion of “Party of Five,” with Wolf feeling like he has to “protect” his younger co-star at times.</p><p>“I always felt this protective thing with Lacey,” he said. “She was only 11 years old. And knowing she was a child at the time, working in a very adult environment, I just felt immediately protective of her. But it wasn’t because she gave off this sense of, ‘I need protecting.’”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGpma2lfmru1sdGtmKKmnZq7tXvPmqmtsV2ks26yyK%2BcrGWclrCmxYycn5qalafBbr%2FCqKutZaekuad5wqWYq6GWrnqprculpJqqm2K5sMLEZqCnrJWnsrTAjKuspqeiqHw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-titans-has-armin.html><span>←</span><span>What Titans has Armin?</span></a>
