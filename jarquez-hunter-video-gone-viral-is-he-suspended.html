Is he suspended following the incident? Get insights on Jarquez Hunter Video.</strong></p><p>Jarquez Hunter is a running back for the Auburn Tigers in American football. Hunter was Auburn’s second running back as a freshman, trailing only Tank Bigsby.</p><p>Hunter established an Auburn record for the most extended dash in the program’s history during the Tigers’ Week 2 game against Alabama State with a 94-yard touchdown run.</p><p>He ran for 593 yards in total in 2021, at 6.7 yards per carry.&nbsp;</p><p>In the last 48 hours, multiple videos allegedly involving Hunter in explicit activities have emerged on the internet.</p><p>Is the player and student from Auburn suspended after this incident? Let’s find out.</p><h2>Jarquez Hunter Video: Is The Running Back For Auburn Tigers Suspended?</h2><p>Yes, Jarquez and an unknown number of Auburn University students have been suspended for their alleged involvement in a video.</p><p>The video purports to show junior running back Jarquez Hunter partaking in lewd behavior.</p><p>However, the school and not the athletic department were responsible for the indefinite suspensions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/geniuscelebs.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/jarquez-hunter-1024x538.jpg><p>So, we are unsure whether Jarquez is participating in the football team. Brian Stultz of Rivals first reported the statement from Auburn.</p><p>Auburn stated they knew the circumstance and took this matter seriously, and the relevant departments are reviewing it carefully.</p><p>They also stated that indefinite suspensions had been issued for violations of the relevant policy of the Auburn Athletics Department, and they won’t make any more comments now.</p><p>Given that the University provided this information, Auburn football has not disclosed the identities of any banned players. Non-athletes may also be a part of the group.</p><h2>Jarquez Hunter Video And Tape Viral On Twitter</h2><p>It all began when several videos circulated on social media over the past 48 hours, purportedly showing Hunter engaging in sexual activity.</p><p>Before the account was locked, a video that depicted someone capturing a sexual act with an unnamed female was made public.</p><p>Twitter suspended the account uploading the videos on Wednesday night, which happened on Thursday afternoon.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/geniuscelebs.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Jarquez-Hunter-Twitter-1-1024x747.jpg><p>The school is looking into the situation and how these videos ended on social media. Whether all parties were aware they were being filmed is unknown now.</p><p>Late Friday night, the account that was tweeting the footage became private. The account’s administrator told Twitter they could pay $5 to view the video.</p><p>More potential problems for all parties involved could result from this.</p><p>It’s unclear if those who made the film knew it would be widely shared. How the footage was made available this week on social media is likewise unknown.</p><p>Trending Now: <a href=#>Why Did Heather Unbehaun Lose Custody?
