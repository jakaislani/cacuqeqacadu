His folksy wit and common sense attitude made him one of the most famous actors and authors in the world in the 1920s and '30s.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Rogers was born on November 4, 1879, in present-day Oologah, Oklahoma — then part of Indian territory. Rogers grew up in a ranching family. Himself part Cherokee, Rogers socialized with both Indigenous peoples and Anglo-American settlers in the immediate area. He left Oklahoma as a teenager, eventually finding work in the traveling Wild West shows popular at the time.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Career</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1905, Rogers began performing a lasso act on the vaudeville circuit. His charm and humor, along with his technical ability, made Rogers a star. Audiences responded with enthusiasm to his off-the-cuff remarks delivered while performing elaborate roping tricks.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Rogers parlayed his vaudeville success into a Broadway career. He debuted in New York in 1916, performing in The Wall Street Girl. This led to many more theatrical roles, including headlining appearances in the Ziegfeld Follies. Rogers also brought his act to the burgeoning medium of the moving picture. He appeared in dozens of silent films, often playing a country bumpkin trying to negotiate the modern world.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In addition to acting, Rogers became nationally-known as a writer. He penned a column for the Saturday Evening Post that ran in newspapers across the country. His columns dealt with contemporary issues from a perspective of small-town morality, emphasizing the integrity of working people. It was a viewpoint that resonated in the rapidly industrializing twentieth-century United States. Many of his books, including The Cowboy Philosopher on Prohibition and There's Not a Bathing Suit in Russia, achieved best-seller status.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Rogers's fame had eclipsed his country bumpkin persona by 1930. No longer believable as an uneducated outsider, he was able to voice his characteristic wit and wisdom while playing a professional. Legendary director John Ford worked with Rogers on three of these later films—Doctor Bull, Judge Priest and The Steamboat Round the Bend. After filming concluded on the final Ford film, in 1935, Rogers set out on a trip to Alaska. An avid aviation enthusiast, he planned to explore remote stretches by plane as well as on foot.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Death</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On August 15, 1935, the plane carrying Rogers crashed in Point Barrow, Alaska. He died on impact. Millions across the country mourned the sudden silencing of a quintessentially American voice.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1991, a Broadway show based on Rogers brought renewed attention to his life and humor. The Will Rogers Follies, starring Keith Carradine, focused on Rogers's performances as a headliner of the Ziegfield Follies. The show won several Tony Awards, including for best musical, best musical score and best direction.</p><ul data-node-id=20 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: Will Rogers</li><li>Birth Year: 1879</li><li>Birth date: November 4, 1879</li><li>Birth State: Oklahoma</li><li>Birth City: Oologah</li><li>Birth Country: United States</li><li>Gender: Male</li><li>Best Known For: Will Rogers was an American humorist, actor and author best known for his Broadway and film performances, as well as his folksy persona.</li><li>Industries</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Theater and Dance</li><li>Comedy</li><li>Drama</li></ul><li>Astrological Sign: Scorpio</li><li>Death Year: 1935</li><li>Death date: August 15, 1935</li><li>Death State: Alaska</li><li>Death City: Point Barrow</li><li>Death Country: United States</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><br data-node-id=23><ul data-node-id=25 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: Will Rogers Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/actors/will-rogers</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E; Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: April 19, 2021</li><li>Original Published Date: April 2, 2014</li></ul><ul data-node-id=28 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Every time Congress makes a joke it's law, and every time they make a law it's a joke.</li><li>I never met a man I didn't like.</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGiYnKyfp8Bww8ilo2aqn5yys78%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-sonya-jackman-hugh-jackmans-sister-age-wiki-bio-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Sonya Jackman?
