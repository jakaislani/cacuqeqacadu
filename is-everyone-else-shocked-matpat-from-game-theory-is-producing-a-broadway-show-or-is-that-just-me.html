Didn’t expect that in my mid-year bingo cards.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=406 data-current-count=406 data-injectable=true>Arthur McDaniel, also known as the GamerFromMars, shared a photo of him and MatPat, with the caption “Went to a preview of the new @MatPatGT produced Broadway show, Grey House.” Apparently, MatPat produced a Broadway show&nbsp;without anyone knowing. This went down in between selling the Theorist company that he and his wife own, running four main YouTube channels, and taking care of his family.</p><p data-characters=174 data-current-count=174 data-injectable=false>And knowing how big this man is on the internet, with over 17 million subscribers on The Game Theorist channel alone, I’m surprised that nobody leaked this information.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=474 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Went to a preview of the new <a href=#>@MatPatGT</a> produced Broadway show, Grey House.</p><p>I would highly recommend it if you're in New York soon! <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/oUHFDpcvRq</a></p>— Art M.

How did no one find out about this until today? Was any of this revealed in GT Live? Twitter? Because this has to be a better-kept secret than whatever Marvel is working on behind closed doors right now.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=676 data-injectable=true><a href=#>MatPat co-produced the Broadway show I saw last night…I had no idea</a><br>by <a href=#>u/GooGooGajoob67</a> in <a href=#>GameTheorists</a></figure><p data-characters=503 data-current-count=503 data-injectable=true>Per the play’s&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">official website</a>,&nbsp;Grey House&nbsp;is a horror show about a couple who sought shelter in an isolated cabin. Their host showed eagerness to make their guest feels right at home, but that’s just part of what made this stay feel all too suspicious.
