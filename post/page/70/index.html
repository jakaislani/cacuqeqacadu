Mofe loses his family (and his assets, which have been kept in Precious‚Äô name) overnight, and he enters several bureaucratic mazes; one to obtain a proper burial for his relatives, another to get back what‚Äôs his. His crass father laughs it up when Mofe arrives with some bodies in tow, and skimps on coffins; he gloats upon introducing Mofe to a lawyer cousin. That cousin later shows up to contest Mofe‚Äôs claim on Precious‚Äôs estate on behalf of the father.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Gluten Free Banana Bread</h2><time>May 5, 2024</time>

At first, Ko‚Äôs film plays like a bleak drama evocative of Calin Peter Netzer‚Äôs Romanian heart-tugger, ‚ÄúChild‚Äôs Pose,‚Äù as Paul and his ex-wife, Christine (Ulrike C.
