The first player selected in the 1970 NFL draft, Bradshaw went to great success with the Pittsburgh Steelers. During his 14-year NFL career, he helped take his team to the Super Bowl several times and rightfully earned four Super Bowl rings. Following his Hall of Fame career, he became a leading television personality and analyst for the NFL.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Years</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Former professional football player, television host, author and actor Terry Paxton Bradshaw was born on September 2, 1948, in Shreveport, Louisiana. One of the greatest quarterbacks in NFL history, Bradshaw has spent much of his life playing, reporting and commenting on football. Named an All-American while starring for Louisiana Polytechnic Institute, he was selected first overall in the 1970 NFL draft by the Pittsburgh Steelers.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Pittsburgh Steelers and Super Bowl Championships</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">During his first few years, Bradshaw struggled to find his footing with the team. Some people made jokes about his intelligence, calling him "dumb" and the "Bayou Bumpkin," but during the 1974 season, he showed his opponents and critics that he was a force to be reckoned with by leading the Steelers to a Super Bowl victory over the Minnesota Vikings.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The next year, he and his teammates took on the Dallas Cowboys to win the Super Bowl again. These two teams faced off in 1978 for Super Bowl XIII, with Steelers winning by a narrow margin, 35 to 31. Bradshaw was selected as the Super Bowl Most Valuable Player and the NFL Player of the Year for his accomplishments on the field.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">With an arm like a cannon, Bradshaw continued to succeed as quarterback of the Steelers. He won the Super Bowl MVP Award again in 1980 after helping his team defeat the Los Angeles Rams. Unfortunately, he began having difficulty with the muscles in one of his elbows. Bradshaw had surgery to correct the problem, but he returned before he was fully healthy and ended up with permanent damage, forcing his retirement after just one game played in 1983.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Bradshaw was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1989, his first year of eligibility.</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Sports Commentator</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Having been a guest commentator for CBS Sports over the years, Bradshaw became one of the network's game analysts.

With a sharp strategic mind and a warm sense of humor, Bradshaw has emerged as one of football's most popular commentators.</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Author, Singer and Actor</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In addition to his broadcast work, Bradshaw is an author, singer, actor and motivational speaker.
