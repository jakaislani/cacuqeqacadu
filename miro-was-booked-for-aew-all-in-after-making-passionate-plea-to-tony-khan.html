That being said, Miro made a passionate plea to Tony Khan, and that got him on the show.</p><p>“Miro and Will Hobbs were not originally planned to appear on AEW All In. However, we’re told that Miro went to Tony Khan and passionately pled to be on the show, unhappy he wasn’t in any capacity. A compromise was made to have the contract signing element added.”</p><p>Miro is not booked in a match at WrestleDream, but he is currently involved in an on-screen storyline with his real-life wife, CJ Perry. She wants to manage Miro in AEW, but he wants to go it alone. Only time will tell what happens in that angle.</p><p>AEW has quite a lot in store for fans, and we will have all the coverage here at <a href=#>Ringside News</a>.
