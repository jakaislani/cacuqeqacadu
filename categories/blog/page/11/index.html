<a href=../../../../show.html></a>
The first part of the HyperZ technology is the Hierarchical Z feature. This feature basically allows for the pixel being rendered to be checked against the z-buffer before the pixel actually hits the rendering pipelines. This allows useless pixels to be thrown out early, before the Radeon has to render them.
Next we have Z-Compression. As the name implies, this is a lossless compression algorithm (no data is lost during the compression) that compresses the data in the Z-buffer thus allowing it to take up less space which in turn conserves memory bandwidth during accesses to the Z-buffer.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Lionel Messi Parents, Bio, Career, Net Worth, Awards and Life</h2><time>Aug 25, 2024</time>
