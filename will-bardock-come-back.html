Bardock was never killed by Frieza when he unleashed that supernova ball on planet Vegeta. He was transported nack into the past where he encountered Frieza's ancestor, Chilled, and transformed into a Super Saiyan making his PL way above 10,000 now.</span></span><h2>Can Goku wish back Bardock?</h2>Re: Why can't they wish back Bardock and Gine? Goku does not care about his biological parents and thus he has no reason to bring them back, nothing more nothing less. Dragon Ball was never a mature IP and some fans should start accepting that and stop being in denial.<h2>Did Bardock still alive?</h2>So canonically, Bardock is dead. But non-canonically, he had survived his demise and survived by going back in time (unclear if he's still alive). And as for the future, it remains unaffected.<h2>Is Bardock sent back in time?</h2>Timeline placement<p>Bardock is then sent far back in time, to before the Saiyans had arrived on Planet Vegeta, and the rest of the animation takes place at this point in time. The sections occurring in the past happen before the Saiyans arrived on Planet Plant, at some point around 1104 Before Age.</p><h2>Will Bardock ever meet Goku?</h2>The life of Bardock was recently explored in the anime via the latest film in the Shonen franchise, Dragon Ball Super: Broly, with the movie taking a moment to show Bardock and Gine sending a young Goku into the stratosphere to escape Freeza's attack and the destruction of the Planet Vegeta.<h2>Dragon Ball Super just SHOCKED EVERYONE! BARDOCK RETURNS!</h2><p></p><h2>Where is Bardock now?</h2>As he is being overwhelmed by Frieza's Supernova, Towa uses a wormhole to capture him, however, he runs to the past. Bardock survives after his battle against Frieza and wakes up in a bed on a planet that looks a lot like Planet Vegeta.<h2>Will Goku see his father again?</h2>Given the current story and timeline, he will not. They are already dead without Goku knowing or caring about them. However, there is always a chance for them to come back. Dragon Ball is an anime where being dead is not such a big deal; you can just wish your dead ones back from the Shenrons.<h2>Is Bardock the legendary Super Saiyan?</h2>Both Bardock and Broly are legendary super saiyans but Bardock was the original super saiyan of legend if onely Vegeta would have known that a "lowclass" was the original super saiyan. It would blow his mind and the fact that it was Goku's father.<h2>How does Bardock come back to life?</h2>Yes He can be Revived But........<p>Bardock was never killed by Frieza when he unleashed that supernova ball on planet Vegeta. He was transported nack into the past where he encountered Frieza's ancestor, Chilled, and transformed into a Super Saiyan making his PL way above 10,000 now.</p><h2>Why didn't Bardock go Super Saiyan against Frieza?</h2>He couldn't because the Super Saiyan transformation only multiplies power 50X. Bardock's power level is 10,000. 50 X 10,000 would be 500,000. Even in his first form, Frieza's power level is 530,000, meaning Bardock would be beaten by great margin even if Frieza didn't transform.<h2>Is Bardock a good guy?</h2>He has traits of both a bad guy & a good guy. Even though he has exterminated whole races, he cared about his comrades, his son(s?) even though he didn't want to show it, he (nearly) died to protect his race, and he even cared about the Plantians, mostly about Berry.<h2>Is Yamoshi a Bardock?</h2>Yamoshi is actually Bardock : r/dragonball.<h2>What did Bardock wish for?</h2>According to Dragon Ball Super's manga translation, Bardock's exact words are "I'd wish that my sons end up thriving." So just to reiterate: Bardock's wish (and really, his deeper logic as a Saiyan) was to see his sons "thrive" through the act of simply growing up into strong men.<h2>Did Bardock care about Raditz?</h2>But as fans know all too well, Bardock has two sons in the series' canon. Which means that Bardock not only cared for Raditz much less, but also goes to show that while Bardock was changing, it came much later than it probably should have.<h2>Can Raditz be revived?</h2>He wasn't revived at any point in the canon series and remained at best a footnote. Even his initially impressive power-level was soon made redundant by elements like the Saibamen, artificially-grown soldiers used by Vegeta and Nappa that were roughly the same power level as Raditz.<h2>Did Bardock care about Goku?</h2>Bardock initially didn't care about Goku either. He only started to have an interest in Goku once he started getting visions of him in the future. So Bardock really on cared about Goku because he knew he would survive.<h2>Why didn't Vegeta wish back Saiyans?</h2>TL;DR Vegeta was never too interested in any Saiyan's wellbeing but his own / after his 'change of heart' he wouldn't have been able to overcome the combined forces of the other Super Saiyans for a selfish wish, even if he had wanted to make one.<h2>Can Bardock see the future?</h2>In Dragon Ball Xenoverse, Bardock's ability to see the future is mentioned in the Legendary Super Saiyan Saga by Future Trunks who explains that it is due to this ability that Bardock is aware that Dark Broly must not be allowed to interfere with Super Saiyan Goku epic battle with Frieza on Dying Planet Namek.<h2>Does Bardock appear in Dragon Ball super?</h2>Dragon Ball Super (manga)<p>Bardock appears in the flashback scenes of Dragon Ball Super manga adaption's chapter 77, takes place after Goku's birth and prior to both Dragon Ball Minus and Bardock - The Father of Goku.</p><h2>Is Yamoshi alive?</h2>On a similar note, Vegeta when describing the Super Saiyan state indicates that Yamoshi ultimately ended up killed as a result of his own power destroying him, which was similar to the Legendary Super Saiyan state that was implied by Broly and Kale regarding their need to vent energy.<h2>Is Turles Bardock's son?</h2>Bardock and Son family tree<p>Bardock and his wife Gine gave birth to Raditz and Kakarot. Turles is Goku's older brother. However, some other sources do not refer to them as related.</p><h2>Is Bardock stronger than Broly?</h2>bardock was the strongest saiyan when the planet exploded, unless youn include broly, however broly is not canon as the movies are not considered canon. bardock the father of goku was a special, not a movie and was considered canon by akira toriyama, so much so that he put bardock in the updated manga.<h2>Can Raditz go Super Saiyan?</h2>Raditz may be the only Saiyan whose hair actually grows longer as he grows up, which carries over into his Super Saiyan 3 form.<h2>Who is stronger Goku or Bardock?</h2>2 Goku. Initially, Goku struggled to defeat normal Earthlings like Yamcha, Master Roshi, and Tien, all characters that Bardock would defeat without even trying. At this point in the story, Goku has far surpassed Bardock, becoming the first Super Saiyan God in centuries.<h2>Why is Raditz hair so long?</h2>Therefore Raditz's hair must have something to do with a recessive gene. Goku goes more primal in this state and also emphasises this long hair gene. The only other SSJ3 we've seen is Gotenks. We don't know how fusion works completely, but Goten would also have this gene.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye9aio6Vlkpa%2FpbvCpGScp52aeqOtwqQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-the-main-character-in-yu-yu-hakusho.html><span>←</span><span>Who is the main character in Yu Yu Hakusho?</span></a>
