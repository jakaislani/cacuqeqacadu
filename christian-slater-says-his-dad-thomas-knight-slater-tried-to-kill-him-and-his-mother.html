Christian Slater has revealed that his father once tried to kill him and his mum as he hits back against the $20 million lawsuit brought against him by his dad.
The Mr Robot star has filed documents to have Thomas Knight Slater's $20 million defamation lawsuit against the actor and his mother, casting agent Mary Jo Slater, thrown out of court.
TMZ reports that Slater says his father is a manic depressive schizophrenic who was taken to hospital in 1972 in a straitjacket because he threatened to kill his wife and a then three-year-old Christian."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
