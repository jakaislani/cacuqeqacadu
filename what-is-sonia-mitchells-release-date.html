During that time, Mitchell said in her testimony she was emotionally and physically abused, but details of the case led the judge to doubt certain aspects of her story.</p><h2 id=h-what-did-sonia-mitchell-do data-injectable=false>What did Sonia Mitchell do?</h2><p data-characters=189 data-current-count=189 data-injectable=false>Based on further reporting from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Pueblo Chieftain</a>, Sonia Mitchell said she stabbed and bludgeoned her common-law husband after a day of physical and sexual abuse. Mitchell said in court,</p><p>“I opened the door, and there was a weight on the floor, and I kicked it. When I kicked it, I snapped. I remember hitting him once, but I don’t remember much after that. I remember stabbing him, but I don’t know how many times. After, I remember sitting there thinking: ‘He’s going to get up and he’s going to get me. He’s going to get up and he’s going to get me.'”</p>via The Pueblo Chieftain<p data-characters=383 data-current-count=383 data-injectable=false>After Brian Swartz, an alleged drug dealer, died, Mitchell then solicited the help of three friends to bury his body in a shallow grave, and denied the crime for weeks afterward.

Mitchell also stole money and guns from Swartz’s safe.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Sonia Mitchell was sentenced to 20 years in prison</h2><p data-characters=371 data-current-count=754 data-injectable=true>When Sonia Mitchell’s verdict was read, the judge in the case said he had no doubt Mitchell had reason to be afraid of Brian Swartz. But based on Mitchell’s behavior after Swartz died, he would choose a middle ground in her sentencing on charges of second-degree murder in the heat of passion. Those charges could carry anywhere from 10 to 32 years in prison.</p><p data-characters=106 data-current-count=106 data-injectable=false>In 2011, Mitchell received a 20-year prison sentence meaning she’s expected to be released in 2031.</p><p data-characters=45 data-current-count=151 data-injectable=false>The judge, David Crockenberg, said in court,</p><p>&nbsp;“[T]he problem with what happened that particular night is that Brian Swartz is not here to testify. I also agree that if Miss Mitchell said why she did it, charges may have never been filed. But her actions after lead me to believe that her version of events wasn’t accurate.”</p>via The Pueblo Chieftain<p data-characters=60 data-current-count=60 data-injectable=false>Season 23 of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Snapped</a> is available to stream now on Peacock.</p><p data-characters=314 data-current-count=374 data-injectable=false>If you are experiencing domestic abuse, or if you believe someone you know is being abused, contact <a href=#>The National Domestic Violence Hotline</a>.
