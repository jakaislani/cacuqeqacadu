It’s always interesting to learn how iconic brands like these achieve their status in the food and beverage world. So today, let’s take a look at everything you ever need to know about Pepsi.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-is-pepsi><strong>What is Pepsi?</strong></h2><p>Pepsi is one of the many varieties of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">cola-flavored sodas</a> on the market. The “cola” refers to the kola nut, which was the source of the drink’s caffeine way back when it was invented. I’ve never tasted a kola nut, so I don’t know if the flavor of the soda aligns with its namesake.&nbsp;</p><p>The modern cola flavor is an amalgamation of cinnamon, vanilla, and either orange, lime, or lemon citrus oils. Many of these ingredients are artificially created. Pepsi’s ingredients are: carbonated water, high fructose corn syrup, caramel color, sugar, phosphoric acid, caffeine, citric acid, and natural flavors. They are open with their formula, unlike their sneaky <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Coca-Cola competitor</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-invented-pepsi-and-when-was-pepsi-invented><strong>Who invented Pepsi and when was Pepsi invented?</strong></h2><p>In 1983, a gentleman named Caleb Bradham created Pepsi to sell in his New Bern, North Carolina drugstore. He initially called it “Brad’s Drink,” which really doesn’t explain what it is.</p><p>Bradham changed the name to Pepsi-Cola in 1898. The cola part makes sense, but what about the Pepsi part? Way back when sodas were being invented, they were often sold under the auspices of providing some health benefit. For example, Coca-Cola was marketed as a cure for, among other things, morphine addiction. The Pepsi name is a reference to its purported ability to cure dyspepsia aka indigestion.&nbsp;</p><p>Pepsi-Cola rose in popularity throughout the 20th century and in 1961, it changed its name to simply Pepsi. Since then, the brand has experienced huge growth and there has been a proliferation of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Pepsi varieties</a> including the infamous <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Crystal Pepsi</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-much-caffeine-is-in-pepsi><strong>How much caffeine is in Pepsi?</strong></h2><p>A 12 oz can of Pepsi contains 38 mg of caffeine. This is on par with its cola competitors; Coca-Cola has 34 mg per 12 oz can. For reference, a cup of black tea has 47 mg and a cup of coffee has 95 mg. Pepsi does have a caffeine-free version, though, which has been available since 1982.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-were-the-cola-wars><strong>What were the Cola Wars?</strong></h2><p>If you ever go to a movie theater or a fast food restaurant, you’ll notice that they either sell Coca-Cola products or Pepsi products. The lines are strictly drawn thanks to the long-standing Cola Wars.&nbsp;</p><p>In the 1980s, both Coca-Cola and Pepsi were vying for cola supremacy and started aggressive, targeted marketing campaigns to corner the market. Marketing tactics like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Pepsi Challenge</a> put the drinks side by side, showing customers preferring one over the other.&nbsp;</p><p>Even though they don’t acknowledge it much in their advertising now, the rivalry between the brands remains to this day.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-did-the-pepsi-kid-get-the-jet><strong>Did the Pepsi kid get the jet?</strong></h2><p>One of Pepsi’s many advertising strategies nearly bit them in the butt. In the 1990s, Pepsi started their Pepsi Stuff campaign in which fans could accumulate Pepsi Points and trade them in for swag like a T-shirt or leather jacket. This <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">1996 commercial</a> ends with a teen landing a Harrier jet in front of his school that he “won” by accumulating 7,000,000 Pepsi Points.</p><p>Well, an enterprising college student named John Leonard wanted to test the contest. Using a loophole he found while reading the terms and conditions, he managed to source $700,000—the cash equivalent of the 7,000,000 points—through the help of investors, including a millionaire mountaineering friend named Todd Hoffman. He sent it to PepsiCo, demanding his jet. Pepsi refused, so Leonard sued.</p><p>Sadly, the court ruled in favor of PepsiCo, so there was never a 21-year old with his own war weapon. Pepsi continued to air the commercial, but changed the point total to 700,000,000 with a “just kidding” disclaimer. If you want to know more, there was a Netflix original docu-series on the subject called <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Pepsi, Where’s My Jet?</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaK%2BYlsFutdJmp56oo558</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./david-familyfunpack.html><span>←</span><span>David FamilyFunPack Net Worth, Age, Girlfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</span></a>
