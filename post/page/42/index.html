There is a possibility, subscribed to by everybody but never quite put into words, that she is mentally ill. She's certainly flighty. She overflows with enthusiasms, and then is brought low by tormenting doubts, and her optimism has hard sailing into the gales of Grandma's scorn.
For the boys, Aunt Bella is a pal in a strange new land.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Never Grow Old movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2019)</h2><time>Jun 26, 2024</time>

Hugh Grant as Phoenix Buchanan in "Paddington 2"
In “Paddington 2,” Phoenix Buchanan is an Actor with a capital A. Well, actually, he’s a has-been Actor.
