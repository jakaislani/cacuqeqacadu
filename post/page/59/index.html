There is nothing so divisive as the battle between relationship camps on television. And though Nickelodeon‚Äôs Avatar: The Last Airbender was an animated series aimed at a young demographic, it was no different. Romances in the animated series are pretty cut and dry. From the moment Aang (Zach Tyler Eisen) lays eyes on Katara (Mae Whitman), he is smitten with her. For her part, Katara first sees the last airbender as a little brother before they ultimately get together in the final episodes of the show.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Xeon E-2174G, E-2134, and E-2104G Tested</h2><time>May 25, 2024</time>

I know this sounds like a contrarian position, but maybe 1994‚Äôs Street Fighter actually does have a lot of redeemable qualities that are often overlooked. I say this as a skeptic, mind you, so let me explain why I think it deserves a second chance.
Recommended Videos You see, 1995‚Äôs Mortal Kombat is often viewed by video game fanatics as the first ‚Äúgood‚Äù adaptation of the medium. However, in spite of Street Fighter releasing one year prior ‚Äî and both films holding ‚ÄúRotten‚Äù status on Rotten Tomatoes ‚Äî it seems like people love to trash on Street Fighter more.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>8 Things You Didnt Know About Emily Alyn Lind</h2><time>May 24, 2024</time>

These kids have nothing in common, and they have an aggressive desire not to have anything in common. In ways peculiar to teenagers, who sometimes have a studious disinterest in anything that contradicts their self-image, these kids aren't even curious about each other. Not at first, anyway. But then the day grows longer and the library grows more oppressive, and finally the tough kid can't resist picking on the prom queen, and then there is a series of exchanges.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../post/page/58/>‚Üê Prev Page</a>
