Rattled off to hearty laughter and applause, the words were: s**t, p**s, f**k, c**t, c********r, m**********r, and t**s.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The bit was meant to highlight the absurdity of signaling a few words out of the roughly 400,000 in the English language that would somehow corrupt our souls by repeating them for public consumption, and Carlin effectively made his point with silly voices and simple logic.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But the funnyman knew he was treading in dangerous territory: He had been with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/celebrities/lenny-bruce data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Lenny Bruce" class="body-link css-9bav67 e1k3dme10">Lenny Bruce</a> a decade earlier when his mentor was arrested in Chicago for saying at least two of those forbidden words during a show.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Sure enough, Carlin met the same fate in Milwaukee a few months after debuting his "Seven Words." His arrest was eventually thrown out, but the bigger battle was just beginning.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">A radio listener’s complaint sent the case to court</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">At around 2:00 p.m. on October 30, 1973, East Coast station WBAI-FM warned it was about to air a recording with potentially offensive language and proceeded to play an offshoot of Carlin's routine, this one titled "Filthy Words."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">CBS executive John Douglas, a member of a watchdog group called Morality in Media, listened to the broadcast alongside his 15-year-old son as they drove home. Appalled, he filed a complaint with the Federal Communications Commission a few weeks later over the language aired in the middle of the day.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In February 1975, the FCC issued a declaratory order that determined the broadcast to be "indecent" and threatened to impose sanctions on the Pacifica Foundation, who owned WBAI, over any subsequent complaints. Pacifica challenged this finding in court, and in 1977 the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled in favor of the broadcast entity by a 2-1 margin, sending the case all the way up to the Supreme Court.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On July 3, 1978, the Supreme Court issued its landmark ruling in Federal Communications Commission v. Pacifica Foundation, upholding the FCC's power to determine language guidelines and limitations by a 5-4 margin. Penning the majority decision, Justice John Paul Stevens cited the need for such regulation due to broadcast media's "uniquely pervasive presence in the lives of all Americans."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But Justice William Brennan slammed the "misapplication of fundamental First Amendment principles," in his dissent, writing, "The Court's decision may be seen for what, in the broader perspective, it really is: another of the dominant culture's inevitable efforts to force those groups who do not share its mores to conform to its way of thinking, acting, and speaking."</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">The legal issue of ‘indecency’ returned to courts years later</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After the turn of the century, the issue returned to the forefront amid a changing media landscape. Along with the increasing popularity of cable television, the proliferation of the internet, with its burgeoning social media platforms, introduced new avenues for off-color language (and other content) to reach audiences.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But it was traditional broadcast media that found itself in hot water for profanity, specifically for the f-bombs uttered by celebrities like <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/bono data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Bono class="body-link css-9bav67 e1k3dme10">Bono</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/cher data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Cher class="body-link css-9bav67 e1k3dme10">Cher</a> during live awards telecasts. After the FCC revised its policy to prohibit such "isolated and fleeting" expletives, the Fox network launched a lawsuit to fight these restrictive measures.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2009's Federal Communications Commission v. Fox Television Stations, the Supreme Court upheld the power of the FCC in this case but punted the issue of a broader ruling on censorship back to the lower courts for examination.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After the Second Circuit Court found the FCC's policy to be "unconstitutionally vague" in 2010, FCC v. Fox returned to the Supreme Court in 2012. This time, the Court ruled against the FCC, but on the grounds that the Commission had violated due process by not giving a proper warning about its revised policy. Majority opinion author Justice <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/legal-figures/anthony-kennedy data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Anthony Kennedy" class="body-link css-9bav67 e1k3dme10">Anthony Kennedy</a> noted that the ruling did not touch on the constitutionality of the policy itself, essentially leaving things as they had been since FCC v. Pacifica was decided in 1978.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Carlin was thrilled his routine impacted the American legal system</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Meanwhile, the man who set all of this into motion had passed on to the great stand-up stage in the sky. Carlin's career was hardly derailed by the brouhaha over his language – he went on to host the inaugural episode of Saturday Night Live, 14 HBO specials, his own sitcom, and parts in popular films like Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure. Shortly after his death in 2008, he was awarded the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">His "Seven Dirty Words" retains its biting humor and endures as one of the most famous stand-up bits in history. But for all its quotability, Carlin seemed most pleased by the way his gutter talk penetrated the buttoned-up world of academia and set the tone for a broader discussion.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">"FCC v. Pacifica has become a standard case to teach in communications classes and many law schools. I take perverse pride in that," he wrote in his autobiography, Last Words, adding, "I'm actually a footnote to the judicial history of America."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGijnp%2BRoXqntcauqZ6rX5yysL7GnmScmaKhtq950p6tnqZdrLyzsNJmqq6oopq6pnnCqKyrrA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./robert-brown-now.html><span>←</span><span>British Airways Killer: Where is Robert Brown now?</span></a>
