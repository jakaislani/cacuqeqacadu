As one of the most heart-pounding post-apocalyptic dramas of all-time, it hardly comes as a major surprise that through 11 captivating seasons, AMC‚Äôs The Walking Dead has featured a string of gut-wrenching deaths which have remained in our hearts and minds over the years. But it‚Äôs certainly worth arguing that the most shocking and upsetting death belongs to Glenn Rhee (Steven Yeun) ‚Äî whose demise undoubtedly changed the seriousness and the entire landscape of the show as a whole.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Where Are They Now Wrestler?</h2><time>Aug 12, 2024</time>

[Intro (Spoken)]
(Get ready for action)[Verse 1: Tom DeLonge & (Mark Hoppus)]
I got no regret right now (I'm feelin' this)
The air is so cold and null (I'm feelin' this)
Let me go in her room (I'm feelin' this)
I wanna take off her clothes (I'm feelin' this)
Show me the way to bed (I'm feelin' this)
Show me the way you move (I'm feelin' this)
Fuck it, it's such a blur (I'm feelin' this)</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Brian Banks Movie Review | Brian Banks Movie | Brian Banks</h2><time>Aug 11, 2024</time>

This all happened to Banks. This does happen to people. But as we as a society continue to navigate the tidal wave of the #MeToo movement, with women‚Äôs voices ringing out louder and clearer than ever before, a feel-good story about a man overcoming a wrongful rape accusation just feels sort of ...icky, maybe? It certainly seems off in terms of timing and tone. We are finally believing women when they tell their stories of surviving abuse, and along comes a film that perpetuates some of the most heinous myths and misconceptions about rape: that an accuser is merely making up a story to protect her reputation, avenge hurt feelings or shake someone down for a big payday.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Keynote 2: Nokia CEO Stephen Elop - Qualcomm Uplinq 2011 Day Two Keynote</h2><time>Aug 11, 2024</time>

After Peter, Nokia CEO Stephen Elop took the stage and gave an interesting talk about the future of both Nokia and to discuss their relationship with Qualcomm. Stephen began by acknowledging that just a short time ago, it would have been extremely odd for the Nokia and Qualcomm CEOs to take the stage together - alluding directly to a time when Nokia and Qualcomm were in a heated patent scuffle. With that settled and a commitment to Windows Phone 7 on the horizon, the two have begun a close relationship.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Maitn Montenegros biography, net worth, fact, career, awards and life story</h2><time>Aug 11, 2024</time>
