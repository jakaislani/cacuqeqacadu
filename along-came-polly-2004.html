<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Along Came Polly movie review (2004)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>The problem is that their relationship, and indeed Reuben's entire array of friendships and business associations, are implausible not in a funny way but in a distracting way: We keep doubting that this person would be acting this way in this situation. What kind of a risk assessor is Reuben if he <i>knows</i> he has Irritable Bowel Syndrome, and nevertheless goes on a first date with Polly to dinner at a North African spice palace?</p><p>Yes, his dinner gives the movie the opportunity to launch one of those extended sequences involving spectacular digestive, elimatory and regurgitative adventures, but we're aware it's a set-up. As Stiller himself classically demonstrated in "<a href=#>There's Something About Mary</a>," embarrassment is comic when it is thrust upon you by accident or bad luck, not when you go looking for it yourself.</p><p>Of the Polly character, it can be said that the risk of her ever falling in love with a man like Reuben is a very long shot. What attracts her? His constipated personality? Low self-esteem? Workaholism? Neurotic inability to engage spontaneously with fun?</p><p>She's a free spirit who lives in one of those apartments that look like they were inspired by an old <a href=#>Sandy Dennis</a> movie. Her favorite occupation is salsa dancing, which for her approaches virtual sex, especially with her favorite partner Javier (<a href=#>Jsu Garcie</a>). Reuben, uncoordinated and inhibited, is jealous of Javier until he signs up for salsa lessons, which could have been funny, but are not.</p><p>There isn't a lot in the movie that is funny. I did like <a href=#>Philip Seymour Hoffman</a> as Sandy, Reuben's best man; he's a former child star, now reduced to having strangers tell him how amazed they are that he's still alive. How he responds to this in one early scene is a small masterpiece of facial melodrama, but how many times does he have to slip and fall on slick floors before we get tired of it? I grant him this: He knows exactly how a fat man looks in a red cummerbund from a tuxedo rental agency.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46ao6iml2KwornEZqeopJyuenN8j20%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./8-netflix-thrillers-like-fool-me-once-that-will-leave-you-begging-for-more.html><span>←</span><span>8 Netflix thrillers like Fool Me Once that will leave you begging for more</span></a>
