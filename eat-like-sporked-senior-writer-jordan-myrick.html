We do, however, utilize the product knowledge we gain at work to inform how we shop for our kitchens at home. Here’s a glimpse into senior staff writer <a href=#>Jordan Myrick</a>’s kitchen and the Sporked products that have made their way into Jordan’s daily life.</p><p><strong>8 a.m.&nbsp;</strong><br>I typically don’t eat anything the first few hours of the day. I know, I know. Breakfast is the most important meal. That being said, I’m never hungry when I wake up so I just wait until I am to enjoy my first nosh. I do have a gigantic glass of ice water every morning. I love ice water. If I’m in the office (which I am two days a week), I have a “work Dr Pepper” first thing in the morning. I do not drink coffee because I think it tastes bad. Yes, all of it.</p><p><strong>11 a.m.</strong>&nbsp;<br>Early lunch is king in my house. It is our favorite meal of the day. The most typical lunch is the super quesadilla. Super quesadillas are basically quesadillas that get the taco treatment when it comes to fillings. This gigantic griddled taco starts with a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Guerrero Tortillas de Harina Caseras Tortilla</a> and then I spread on a thick layer of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ducal Refried Black Beans</a> (which I have been eating my entire life). I crisp it up in a hot pan until the outside is crunchy and the beans are hot. Then, I take it out, open it up, and add whatever veggies I have on hand: lettuce, red onion, cherry tomatoes, thinly sliced radish, pickled jalapeños, etc. I finish it off with either <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">El Mexicano Crema Mexicana Sour Cream</a> or <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fage Greek Yogurt</a> (depending on what I have on hand) and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Secret Aardvark Habanero Hot Sauce</a>.</p><p>If I’m in a real hurry, lunch is a handful of pan-fried <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bibigo Organic Vegetable Dumplings</a> and some <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lucky Foods Original Vegan Seoul Kimchi</a> straight from the jar.</p><p>I make gigantic jugs of unsweetened iced tea with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Republic of Tea Ginger Peach Tea</a> bags and drink it with pretty much every meal all week.</p><p><strong>2 p.m.&nbsp;</strong><br>I always have a snack in the middle of the day and that snack is always a savory duo. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mateo’s Gourmet Salsa</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">On the Border Café Style Tortilla Chips</a>. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">365 Roasted Garlic Hummus</a> and Persian cucumbers. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Impossible Nuggets</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Beaver Honey Mustard</a>.</p><p><strong>6:30 p.m.&nbsp;</strong><br>For dinner, we usually have some kind of bowl. They’re filled with anything and everything, but they usually feature white rice, air-fried <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hodo Organic Extra Firm Tofu</a>, and any vegetables I need to use up. Then, I top mine with my homemade, three-ingredient secret sauce: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Duke’s Mayo</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Natural Plus Green Sichuan Chili Oil</a> (one of the best things I’ve tried in my time at Sporked), and sriracha. It’s kind of like a knockoff of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bang Bang Shrimp</a>.</p><p>If I’m feeling depressed (because we all do sometimes), <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celentano Cheese Ravioli</a> is my sadness meal. I toss the pasta with a little <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">vegan butter</a> and a sprinkle of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cavenders All Purpose Greek Seasoning</a>. I know it sounds bizarre to eat vegan butter with cheese ravioli, but I have hereditarily high cholesterol so I try to cut down where I can on the little stuff.</p><p><strong>8 p.m.&nbsp;</strong><br>My girlfriend and I always end the night with a sweet treat, usually while watching a movie at home or in the theater (shoutout AMC A-List). We love <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Flipz Milk Chocolate Covered Pretzels</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Trolli Sour Brite Crawlers</a>. Don’t worry. We definitely buy them at the theater and don’t sneak them inside in our purses.</p><p><strong>11 p.m.&nbsp;</strong><br>Before bed, I have another big glass of tap water on ice because I love water. Night!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJ2RqXqttcqeZKyon6e4prCMrJynoZ%2Bneri%2ByK2cq2WapL%2Blrc1mpLKqmZi4cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./finding-neverland-2004.html><span>←</span><span>Finding Neverland movie review (2004)</span></a>
