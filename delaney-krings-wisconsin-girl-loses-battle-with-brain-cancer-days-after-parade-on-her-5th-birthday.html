"Pay some kindness forward in her name," Krings said. The mother of three continued by saying that the outpouring of love the family has received is a reflection of the love Delaney left behind.

Her illness reportedly began with just an ear infection, that wouldn't go away. Her parents soon her took to a pediatrician, who did some CT scans before revealing that she has a tumor on both sides of her brain, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Daily Mail</a> reported. After leaving Delaney’s diagnosis, her parents decided to celebrate her life on her fifth and last birthday on 16 December.</p><p>Thousands around the world responded to Delaney’s heart-breaking story last year and decided to come together to organize a huge parade for her birthday. With appearances from Olaf, Elsa, and Mickey Mouse among others, the parade was the best gift for little Krings that her family could ever ask for. "It's amazing, and there are so many great people out there doing so much for us. You're really happy to see it, but you wish it wasn't your kid," said Jacob, Krings' father.</p><p>Before this special parade, a special card drive was also organized to celebrate Krings' final birthday. In a previous interview, Heather revealed that the family had already received "hundreds and hundreds" of letters all dedicated to the five-year-old. She added that in addition to cards, Krings also received Amazon packages and homemade items including blankets, bracelets, and ornaments.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRonJWhrq%2Bx2Gaiq6GenMBuw8ismqimo567brPIq6NmpJ%2BosrR5wZqrraSVYsSqwMdmmauZmaN6pK3NnJyrZZSWxrR5wJ%2Brnqpdpa6zrcOeZKimXZ2ys3mUrZ9mmpmnwamwwLI%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./video-lady-rejects-n71-8m-worth-g-wagon-because-of-the-wrong-colour.html><span>←</span><span>Video: Lady Rejects N71.8m Worth G-wagon Because Of the Wrong Colour</span></a>
