He became a partner in the town’s cable TV franchise in 1952, but to do so, Mr. Rigas and his brother, Gus, borrowed heavily.</p><p>Taking on more debt to expand the company became a practice that Mr. Rigas embraced throughout his career. He acquired small suburban cable systems around the country, particularly in South Florida, Western New York and Pennsylvania.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=john-rigas-adelphia-communications></span>John Rigas Adelphia Communications<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Rigas founded Adelphia in 1952.

The money, it turned out, had been made available for the family’s personal use.</p><p>Adelphia’s longtime accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche, refused to sign the company’s annual report to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Adelphia’s already plummeting shares were delisted.

Timothy Rigas was released from prison in July 2019 after serving 12 years.</p><p>Rigas had been offered a reduced sentence in exchange for a guilty plea but he refused maintaining his innocence. During an interview with USA Today he said; “I believe there is a time when you can’t compromise your values. My legacy is to my grandchildren, and you have to stand up — as difficult as it is — for something.
