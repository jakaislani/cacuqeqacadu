As much as we’d all kind of like to see a real kangaroo and a real gorilla fight, we’d like it so much more if they were both intelligent and had access to futuristic weaponry. How could such a scenario possibly get any better — unless maybe it was the two of them becoming best friends after the fight?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoopqml2KzorrSZqeirF2ptaZ5wqilqq2Vp7yzv4ytrqhlk6euu7XErKtmrpGntqK606xkmp%2BRnru0wIyemJygXaTBqbHRZpinnF2jvLh51p5koZmmmnq1u4ysnJ5lmal6qa3PqZynZZmjerSxwqucrWWnlr%2B0ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ethan-torchio-nationality-where-is-ethan-torchio-from-is-ethan-torchio-italian-what-ethnicity-is-ethan-maneskin.html><span>←</span><span>Ethan Torchio Nationality: Where Is Ethan Torchio From?
