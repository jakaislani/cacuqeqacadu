I did not always feel proud of myself while I was laughing, however. The movie is like a depraved extension of "Kids Say the Darnedest Things,'' in which little children repeat what they've heard and we cringe because we know what the words really mean. No target is too low, no attitude too mean or hurtful, no image too unthinkable. After making "South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut,'' its creators, <a href=#>Trey Parker</a> and <a href=#>Matt Stone</a>, had better move on. They've taken "South Park'' as far as it can go, and beyond.</p><p>If you've never seen the original Comedy Central show and somehow find yourself in the theater, you'll be jolted by the distance between the images and the content.</p><p>The animation is deliberately crude, like elements cut out of construction paper. Characters consist of simple arrangements of basic geometrical shapes in bright colors. The effect is of sophisticated kids slamming stuff around on the project table in first grade.</p><p>The story: A new R-rated movie has come to town, starring the Canadian cutups Terrence and Phillip. It's titled "Asses of Fire.'' (That's the mildest vulgarism in the movie.) The South Park kids, who bribe a homeless man to be their "adult guardian,'' attend the movie, drink in its nonstop, wall-to-wall profanity, and startle their class at school with streams of four-letter words.</p><p>One of their moms, deeply offended, forms Mothers Against Canada. The neighbor to the north is blamed for all of U.S. society's ills, Terrence and Phillip are condemned to death, and in retaliation, the Canadian Air Force bombs the Baldwin brothers' Hollywood home. War is declared, leading to scenes your eyes will register but your mind will not believe, such as a USO show involving <a href=#>Winona Ryder</a> doing unspeakable things with Ping-Pong balls.</p><p>The other plot strand begins after little Kenny is killed. (Little Kenny is killed in every episode of the TV series, always with the line, "Oh, my God! They've killed Kenny!'') He goes to hell and finds that Hussein, recently deceased, is having an affair with Satan. Hussein wants sex, Satan wants a meaningful relationship, and they inspire a book titled Saddam Is From Mars, Satan Is From Venus.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46spq6smGK9or7KZpmin5eav264zqeenqpdlruledSnmq6sXWaGeoU%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jackson-wang.html><span>←</span><span>Meet Jackson Wang- Member of South Korean group Got7 Bio &amp;amp; Net Worth</span></a>
